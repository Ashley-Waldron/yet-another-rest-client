Yet Another REST Client
=======================

This is a simple tool for testing REST Services.

The response from the service will be displayed along with any headers in the request/response. 

Every request and response is saved so they can be viewed again at a later stage.



**Installation**

The tool is packaged as a Chrome extension. Installation is trivial. It can be installed from the Chrome Web Store:  TODO


**Request Methods**

Supported: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE / HEAD / PATCH

Requests use GET by default. POST/PUT/PATCH requests should specify a payload.



**Tech**

This is a AngularJS application packaged as a Chrome extension to avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. Bower is used to handle dependencies.
